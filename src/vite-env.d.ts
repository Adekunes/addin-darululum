/**
 * @file src/vite-env.d.ts
 * @summary This TypeScript declaration file is used to provide type definitions for Vite-specific environment variables and client types.
 * 
 * The line `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` is a triple-slash directive that imports type declarations 
 * for Vite's client-side APIs. This allows TypeScript to understand and provide type checking for features 
 * like `import.meta.env` (for environment variables) and HMR (Hot Module Replacement) APIs provided by Vite.
 * It's typically automatically generated or included when setting up a Vite project with TypeScript.
